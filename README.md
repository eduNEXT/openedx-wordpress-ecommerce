# ‚≠ê Open edX Commerce (WordPress Plugin)

The "Open edX Commerce" package is a free and open-source WordPress plugin that allows you to integrate WooCommerce with your Open edX platform.

**What does this mean?**
You can create Open edX courses as products in WooCommerce, and when you perform purchase or refund operations for these products, your Open edX platform will reflect these changes.

Here are some things you can do with this plugin:

- **Create Open edX courses as products:** When you create products using WooCommerce, you can designate them as Open edX courses. If you do, you can assign the course mode and course_id you registered in your Open edX platform.

- **Add settings for the connection with Open edX:** You'll have a new option in your WordPress settings to store authentication-related information for your Open edX platform.

- **Enrollment Manager:** You'll have a table that records all enrollment requests made through purchasing products that are Open edX courses.

- **View the enrollment requests from the orders:** When a person purchases WordPress, a WooCommerce order is generated. If an order includes a product that is an Open edX course, you can easily access the related enrollment request created with this plugin.

- **Create enrollments in Open edX:** When an order containing an Open edX course is processed, it automatically creates an enrollment request.
    - You can also include the option to apply the "force" flag, disregarding the course's enrollment end dates.
    - Starting from version Quince of Open edX, you can use the option to create enrollment allowed for non-registered users on the platform.

- **Create soft unenrollments from refunds:** The enrollment record is maintained, but the "is_active" attribute of the enrollment is false. Deleting an "enrollment allowed" is also supported, but only from version Quince.

- **Obtain enrollment information:** This requests the Open edX APIs to retrieve the enrollment status of a user in a course.

**Note**

This plugin calls the APIs from <a href="https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform" target="_blank">Open edX Platform</a>.

More information about the API connection can be found in <a href="https://github.com/openedx/openedx-wordpress-ecommerce/blob/main/docs/source/decisions/0002-api-connection.rst" target="_blank">Decisions: API connection</a>.
