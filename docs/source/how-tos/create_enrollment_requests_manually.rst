Requisites

To connect with the Open edX platform, you must have valid settings for this plugin. If you do not have this plugin set yet, the :doc:`How-to: Create an Open edX Application for the Plugin Settings </how-tos/create_an_openedx_app>` will be helpful.

Create an Enrollment Request
-----------------------------

#. Enter the Enrollments Manager option in your WordPress dashboard's Open edX Sync tab.

#. Click **Add New** and fill out the form with the following fields:

- **Course ID**: the ID from your Open edX platform course. e.g. ``course-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course``. 

- **User Email**: the user's email address that will be used in the request.

- **Course Mode**: the mode of your enrollment request. Make sure to set a mode that your course has. We only support the modes that come by default on the Open edX platform.

- **Request type**: If you select **Enroll**, you will create an enrollment, and if you choose **Un-enroll**, you will set a soft un-enrollment (enrollment with status inactive) if you update in Open edX.

- **WC Order ID (Auto-filled)**: You can leave this field blank. If your request was created automatically and has an order associated, this field will fill automatically.

Exploring the Enrollment Request View
----------------------------------------

Checkboxs
^^^^^^^^^^

- **Use the "force" flag**: if you select this, the action will not consider the course enrollment end dates.

- **Creating a course enrollment allowed if the user does not exist**: if you select this, create a register in the table Course Enrollment Allowed if the email we use in the request is not a user in our Open edX platform yet. It is available only if you have a release greater or equal to Quince.

Buttons
^^^^^^^^

- **Save in WordPress**: this allows you to store the form information in WordPress.
- **Save and update Open edX**: save the information in WordPress and create a POST API request, considering all the flags and fields except the **WC Order ID.**
- **Read from Open edX**: bring information with GET methods over the API and only use the **Couse ID** and **User email** fields.
- **View Order**: allows you to navigate from the Enrollment Request to the Order associated with that request.
